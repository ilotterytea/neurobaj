# neurobaj

![CI badge](https://github.com/ilotterytea/neurobaj/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A simple example of how neural network text generation works using Markov chains as an illustration.
It may not look exactly like real Markov chains, because I coded it the way I imagined it, based on information I quickly read from Google.
Maybe I'll code more different types of neural networks, like ChatGPT-3 or Midjourney, but that will come later when I have too much free time. ![(cat meme)](https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/63e122bd4af186f390dbd362/1x.webp)
